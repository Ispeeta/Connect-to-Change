                            <p>“We see that pollution is a problem from the cradle to the grave”</p>
                            <p>I came across this powerful quote that not only opened my eyes, but should open yours too. Pollution itself has a variety of different meanings and detriments. However, no matter our views on pollution, we can all agree, its root consequence leads to a much bigger concern; the global climate change.</p>
                            <p>“Climate change is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced.” This is not just a trend we can ignore after a couple days. So, what exactly is climate change? Is it only a series of natural transitions in the weather? Or just a problem which could be solved by one preventative measure? No one can fully answer that question. It refers to the day to day changes in the environment that accumulate to eventually cause much bigger of an issue. These changes  takes a toll on all of us, but do we clearly see how climate change is effecting us?</p>
                            <p>We, as individuals, have been accustomed to normal climatic temperatures but once we experience the two extremes, it is quite difficult to remain used to them. For example, the recent change in Pakistan, which consisted of massively tuned cold waves throughout the country, this affected millions of people and disrupted the animal and plant life. Not only did Pakistan withstand the unusual cold, but there is a guaranteed expectation for a massive heat wave this summer across the country. </p>
                            <p>This extreme weather doesn’t seem like it has woken everyone up. Many people seem to be holding themselves very nonchalantly. It seems as though there is a whole new planet built for us. As if, we can easily fly to a planet B in case of adverse climatic chaos. As if, we already have a plan B waiting in the line for us.</p>
                            <p>Let’s assume in this case, that there is no Plan B, because there is no planet B. What will the  change of climate do to us?</p>
                            <p>The extreme weather conditions have given birth to a number of diseases in the world; some of which were never even heard of previously. Vulnerability levels have been higher than the usual and has adversely affected many of those around us. These diseases can be placed into three catagories; 1) the ones affecting individuals directly, for example, people with breathing problems (through air pollution and other various physical weather disasters). 2) impacts mediated through other ecosystems (like the marine lifestyles, mosquito’s ecology). And 3) indirect consequences, (like resource conflicts, e.g. for water).</p>
                            <p>Climate change, as mentioned previously, disrupts the habitat and lifestyles of people in a variety of ways, the most obvious and common is the increased number and severity of disasters, which destroy homes and habitats forcing people to seek shelter and completely change their lives. Not only this, but such disasters, in addition to rising sea levels, pose significant threat to people living near sea. Such communities are then forced to abandon traditional homelands. Deteriorating climate provides nothing but a forceful way of escaping and evacuating the vicinity.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, about 1600+ deaths have resulted due to heatwaves and wildfires. This is an alarming number which has gone unnoticed, considering the busy lifestyles our community has adopted. In parts of countries like Africa, there is a huge amount of people affected by natural disasters like droughts and have been impacted to their worst. This is all attributed as being the consequences of climate changes.</p>
                            <p>Moving further, another topic that we previously touched upon was global warming. It is a phenomenon that makes more sense when pronounced as a global warning. These extreme weather conditions and the bipolar heat and cold waves are a product of this phenomenon. This gives rise to the concept of greenhouse gases whose concentrations are almost reaching the maximum limits, causing an increase in Earth’s temperature, raising sea levels, increasing the oceanic acidity, and increasing threats to the human health.</p>
                            <p>Coming towards the effects of climate change on forest ecosystems, it is a given fact that the changing climate may worsen the situations of forests in ways that are unimaginable. It affects the forests directly as well as indirectly through changes in temperature, rainfall, weather etc. Climatic change alters the productivity of trees and hampers the growth in most cases. There are higher probability of insect outbreaks, wildfire and uncontrollable storms. The best example that can be used here is that of the huge fires in the Amazon rainforest. It was the fire that led to increased amount of carbon dioxide emissions that caused the greater destruction. In 2011, wildfires affected more than 8 million acres of forests in the U.S. causing more than 15 deaths and more than $1.9 million in damages.</p>
                            <p>Is it imperative for us to save our planet? The obvious and direct answer is YES, we have no other option than to protect and care for this planet, and we must start now before it is too late. Climate change has already destroyed the lives and health of so many living things. During times like these, we must come together as citizens of this Earth and protect it. This is not just a matter of a good, convincing speech rather is a time of urgency. Proper measures need to be taken to stop and potentially reverse the climatic changes.  It will not be done all at once but will take gradual steps from each one of us to actually take place in reality. Let’s just say, we will have to wait another 30 years to actually witness the minimum effects. Assuming there is no Planet B and no last resort for us to escape this issue, we must take action! Not for us, but for the generations that will follow us.  However, considering the amount of negligence our society puts in this regard, it looks like we forget that a plan B does not exist. Hence, it is an urgent call to each individual to pitch in their own part to play.</p>
